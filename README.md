I’m passionate about bridging the worlds of cybersecurity and mechanical engineering. With a double major in both fields, I focus on building secure, scalable systems while leveraging my hands-on experience with cloud platforms, scripting, IT, AI security, machine learning models, and manufacturing technologies.

###  ⚙️ What I Build & Secure 🔍

- **Cybersecurity:** Cloud security, zero trust architecture, ethical hacking, risk management, cryptography, AI security, compliance, & ISO 27001. **(CCSP & SIS & Net+ in progress.)**  
- **Programming:** Fluent in Python, SQL, Ruby, Batch and Bash scripting — building tools, automating tasks, developing security solutions, working with machine learning models, and data analyzation.
- **Mechanical Engineering:** Expert in CAD tools (AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CATIA), MATLAB simulations, and modern manufacturing methods like 3D printing and CNC machining. Deep understanding of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and automotive systems.
