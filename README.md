# Hey there, I’m Dany! :wave: 

**Cybersecurity & Mechanical Engineering Double Major | Zero Trust Architecture | Ethical Hacking | DoD Cyber Sentinel | Cloud & OS Security | ISO 27001 | CSSP (In Progress) | STEM Advocate**

I’m passionate about bridging the worlds of cybersecurity and mechanical engineering. With a double major in both fields, I focus on building secure, scalable systems while leveraging my hands-on experience with cloud platforms, scripting, cryptography, AI security, machine learning models, and manufacturing technologies.
