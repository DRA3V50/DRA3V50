# Hey there, I’m Dany! 😃

**Cybersecurity & Mechanical Engineering Dual Major | Zero Trust Security | Ethical Hacking | DoD Cyber Sentinel | Cloud & OS Security | ISO 27001 | SIEM Engineering | Pursuing: CCSP & Cyber Defense & SIS & Net+ | STEM Advocate**

Languages & tools:  🐍 Python | 🧮 SQL | 🖥️ Bash | 💎 Ruby | ⚙️ C# | 🌐 HTML | 📃 CSS |

I’m passionate about bridging the worlds of cybersecurity and mechanical engineering. With a double major in both fields, I focus on building secure, scalable systems while leveraging my hands-on experience with cloud platforms, scripting, cryptography, AI security, machine learning models, and manufacturing technologies.
